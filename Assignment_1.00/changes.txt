The bugs I found and the changes I made:

1. Swap method

swap method was not working correctly.
a[j] = a[i] and a[j] = temp are the same thing: copy a[i] into a[j].
So, I changed a[j] = a[i] into a[i] = a[j].


2. Partition method

the bug: no increment for storeIndex after swap
So, I added storeIndex++ in if after swapping.

3. nonrecMergeSort method

the bug: no necessary swap inside for loop.
So, I removed the swap method after merge().

I runned with both buggy = true and buggy = false. Everything looks great after fixing those 3 bugs.
