Assignment 5A Changes (Michelle Chan - 28444261)

- Add MiniBall class
- Make changes in Block (collision with mini ball)

First of all, I tried to remove the block by hitting with miniball. not with hitting twice. 
i made changed in BreakOutGame to be able to shoot mini ball straight in Normal State.

Then, I changed Block class to save the old mini ball (with ID) to make the block unactive after hitting twice.

Then, I changed MiniBall class to know the maximum blocks it can destroy, (in our case is 3)

Then, I add time left counter for next miniball in GameState updated by BreakOutGame.

Implemented Observer pattern in GameState using anonymous classes.

Modify Memento in BreakOutGame to save the miniballs.

Lastly, add PowerUpStrategyDecoratorIncrMini(Decorator Pattern) for Level 3, has Red Power Up for increment mini ball count by 3, 
and called from PowerUpFactory for creating PowerUp from BreakOutGame.
